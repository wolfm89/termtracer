# termtracer

A simple ASCII ray tracing app for the terminal, written in Rust.

## About

This is my first Rust project, created to learn:
- Rust programming fundamentals
- Basic ray tracing concepts
- Terminal/CLI rendering with ASCII characters

## Goal

Implement a simple ray tracer that renders 3D scenes directly in the terminal using ASCII characters for shading.
